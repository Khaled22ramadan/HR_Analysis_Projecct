HR Analytics Dashboard aimed at providing critical insights into key workforce metrics

I am pleased to share a recent project I completed, where I utilized "Power BI" to create an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard aimed at providing critical insights into key workforce metrics. The dashboard is designed to help HR departments make data-driven decisions by presenting detailed analytics on the following:

#📊 Employee Demographics:

##Total employees: 689
Gender breakdown: 65.17% female, 34.83% male
💼 Compensation and Experience Analysis:

Monthly and annual salary distribution based on employee experience and job ranking (junior, expert, senior)
Salary trends analyzed across different experience levels
##🕒 Overtime and Departmental Performance:

Detailed analysis of overtime hours by department, helping to identify areas with higher workloads
Comparative insights into department performance and efficiency
##📍 Geographical Distribution:

Mapping of employee distribution across different countries
This dashboard integrates various data points to deliver actionable insights, offering HR teams a clear and concise tool for monitoring employee performance, compensation trends, and departmental efficiencies. The use of Power BI has allowed for the creation of a comprehensive, visually intuitive report, facilitating better decision-making in human resource management.
